🚀 **End-to-End Data Analytics Project: Uber Cab Analysis**
📊 Tools Used: **SQL | Power BI | Excel**

Proud to share my latest project where I built a complete **5-page interactive Power BI dashboard** analyzing Uber cab booking data. This project demonstrates my skills across the full data workflow — from extraction and cleaning in SQL, to analysis in Excel, and visual storytelling in Power BI.

🧠 **Dashboard Overview:**
1️⃣ **Overall Page** – High-level KPIs like total bookings, booking value, status breakdown, and rider volume trends
2️⃣ **Vehicle Type Analysis** – Performance comparison of Prime Sedan, SUV, Auto, Bike, etc., by booking value and distance
3️⃣ **Revenue Insights** – Revenue breakdown by various payment methods
4️⃣ **Cancellations** – Deep dive into ride cancellations with reasons from both drivers and customers
5️⃣ **Ratings** – Customer and driver feedback by car type

💼 **What I Did:**

* Queried and structured large datasets using SQL
* Cleaned and pre-processed data in Excel
* Created intuitive, multi-page Power BI visuals with navigation buttons
* Delivered actionable insights through interactive charts, KPIs, and slicers

🔍 **Key Insights:**

* 62% of rides were successfully completed
* Personal/vehicle issues were top driver cancellation reasons
* Riders often canceled due to drivers not moving toward pickup
* E-Bikes, despite shorter trips, showed strong ratings and value

💡 This project was a great opportunity to showcase my analytical thinking, storytelling, and dashboarding skills — essential qualities for any **Data Analyst** role.
